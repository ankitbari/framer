# Assignment for the junior developer role

## What to build

A landing page in Framer for a fake learning platform. Call it Skillpath.

One section of that page pulls live data from an API. That section is what we're actually looking at. The rest is just the stuff around it.

The page needs three things.

A hero. Headline, one line under it, one button. Design it however you want.

A courses section. This is the real test. More on it below.

A footer. Three links and a copyright line. Don't overthink it.

---

## The courses section

Base URL:

[https://syncsphere-hiv6.onrender.com](https://syncsphere-hiv6.onrender.com)

Two endpoints. Both GET. No auth.

1\. /assignment/course-data

Returns an array of 5 to 10 courses. The count changes between calls, so don't build for exactly 8 cards. Each course looks like this:

{  
  "courseName": "How To YouTube",  
  "courseCode": "how-to-youtube",  
  "description": "From concept to creation, learn how to build, grow, and monetize a YouTube channel using practical systems and real-world execution.",  
  "mainCategory": "Content Creation",  
  "shortCourse": "YouTube",  
  "courseType": "Original",  
  "pricePaise": 199900,  
  "priceUsdCents": 3999,  
  "mangoId": "a1b2c3d4e5f6789012345678",  
  "refundable": true  
}

2\. /assignment/country-code

Returns {"country\_code": "IN"} or {"country\_code": "US"}. It flips between the two.

This decides the price you show. IN means show rupees from pricePaise. US means show dollars from priceUsdCents. Notice the units. 199900 paise is not ₹1,99,900. If a card says that, we stop reading.

Each card shows:

* Course name  
* Description, cut off at two lines, cleanly  
* Price, in the right currency with the right formatting  
* One more field from the data. You pick. Pick the one a real learner would want to see.

## The rules

Build it as a code component.

Not with Framer's Fetch. Fetch can't loop through arrays, so you can't build a grid with it. Write a React code component and do the fetching inside it.

Handle what happens when things go wrong.

We're telling you upfront: this API fails on purpose. Roughly 1 in 3 requests returns a 404 or 500\. Both endpoints. That's not a bug, that's the test.

Four situations. Loading. Error. Zero results. Working.

If your page goes blank or dumps a raw error on screen, you lose this section. And think about what happens when the country call fails but the course call works. What do you show? There's no single right answer. There are wrong ones.

Only GET works.

Every other method returns a 405\. If your component is sending anything else, ask yourself why.

Give us two property controls.

Someone who can't code should be able to change something from the Framer panel without touching your code. You pick which two. Pick the ones a designer would actually ask for.

Make it work on phones.

3 columns on desktop. 2 on tablet. 1 on mobile. Nothing should break in between. Remember the card count varies, so the grid can't assume a nice round number.

Don't hardcode the data.

Obvious, we know. Saying it anyway.

## If you finish early

Only if. Skipping all of this costs you nothing.

* A search box that filters the courses  
* Sort by price  
* Skeleton loaders instead of a spinner  
* A retry button when it fails  
* A "refundable" badge that only shows when it's true

---

## What to share with us

Create a document with the following and paste the link on the form.

1. Your published Framer link. Free account is fine.  
2. Your code. GitHub Gist or a public repo. We want to read it, not look at screenshots.  
3. A short note, 200 words max. What you'd fix with two more days. Where you got stuck. What you're not happy with.  
4. What AI you used.  
5. If you used an AI tool, the shared link to the actual chat. Claude, ChatGPT and Cursor all let you share a conversation. Share that.

---

## About AI

Use it. We use it too.   
Claude, Cursor, ChatGPT, all fine.

Three conditions.

One. Tell us what you used. Something like "AI wrote the first version of the fetch, I rewrote the error handling" is a perfect answer. We're not checking whether you can code without help. We're checking whether you know when the help is wrong.

Two. Share the chat itself. Not a summary of it, the link. We want to see how you asked, what it gave you, and what you did with it. A messy chat with good questions beats a clean chat where you pasted the assignment and hit enter.

Three. You have to be able to explain every line you send us. On the call we'll point at something random and ask you why it's written that way. "The AI wrote that" ends it right there.

Here's the thing. AI made everyone's code look decent. So decent code isn't the bar anymore. Judgement is.

## How we'll score it

Out of 100\.

* Does it work: 30  
* Did you handle loading, errors and empty results, including the flaky API and the currency logic: 25  
* Is the code readable: 15  
* Is it responsive, clean layers, working property controls: 20  
* Your note. How you think, how honest you are: 10

Straight no if:

* The link doesn't open  
* Nothing happens while it's loading  
* The data is hardcoded  
* The price math is wrong  
* You lifted the section off a template  
* You can't explain your own code

---

## What happens after

If it clears the bar, we do a 20 minute call.

We'll open your page, share our screen, and ask you to make one small change while we watch. Nothing hard. Add a field to a card. Change a property control. Takes five minutes if you built it yourself.

That's our only check on whether the work is really yours. And we're telling you about it upfront, on purpose.

---

## If you get stuck

Framer's docs are good. Start at [framer.com/developers](http://framer.com/developers)

You can also email us one question. We'll reply the same day. Asking a sharp question helps you here. It doesn't count against you.

---

## Last thing

We're hiring a junior. We're not expecting senior work.

We want someone who ships something that works, knows what's weak about it, and says so out loud.
